    details: "<span>At St Paul’s upstairs studio – door on side then up stairs.</span><br><br>Times are room booking times. Don't expect to get in if you turn up early. <br><br>Recorded music. Less experienced callers. Experimentation. Things might go wrong! May involve American square dance moves. There's no fixed plan for dances, just a long list of potential ones.<br><br>No expectation for people to swing or twirl more than they want to. Ask us to teach anything you don’t know.<br><br>Cost is room hire split between attendees (around £3 at a guess)."
