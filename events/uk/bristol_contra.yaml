    details: "Bristol Contra Dance is a communal-style folk dance very similar to a Ceilidh. No partner or experience is necessary. A caller leads the dancers through a series of moves. All calling is gender free.\n\nCharlotte Rich-Griffin will be calling with music from Benjamin Rowe & Adam Rich-Griffin.\n\nWe are in the Faith Space Chapel. It's nice and close to Temple Meads and comes with free parking. Check the new Bristol Clean Air Zone information carefully, as this may effect you.\n\nWe have cheese in the break, along with tea, coffee and cordial. You are welcome to bring your own things. Please don't bring alcohol, as this is the venue rule.\n\nBristol Contra is committed to not having the cost of a dance be a hindrance to anyone attending, and have a sliding pay scale.\n\nSuggested prices available on the door:\nUnwaged £6\nWaged £10\nSupporters Ticket £15.\nThe new supporters ticket is a fair representation of what the event costs to run, and supports fair fees for the Band and Caller. It is entirely voluntary.\n\nSo bring your smiles and your joy and come join us for amazing social dancing. Absolutely all welcome of any level of experience for great dancing to some amazing gender-free calling and brilliant music!"
