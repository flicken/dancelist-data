    details: "Fun mixers are on the agenda for the class at 7:30 p.m.      <br><p>Harry Khamis and Pat Pi will teach  Spinnrokken, Petaluma Waltz, and, if there is time, Mona’s Festvals. Spinnrockenis a simple mazurka mixer that includes both the mazurka step and a waltz step. The Petaluma Waltz mixer (also called Olsson's Waltz mixer) is an extension of the Family Waltz that we do almost every first and third Friday. Mona's Festvals, with rousing music written by Benny Andersson (ABBA) and named for his wife, Mona Nörklit, is an exciting circle waltz mixer.</p><p>Music for this evening will be provided by the Folk Voice Band. They will play a variety of music and dance types with plenty of mixers and sets, which are great for newer dancers and always just plain fun for everybody! Don't miss it!</p><u></u>"

This dance is named after Odina Jönsson, 1875–1964, from Allerum, and can be done to both three-beat and two-beat music; i.e., it works for waltz, hambo, mazurka, polska, schottis, snoa, and polka music, making it a “universal” dance. It has a fun bakmes (CCW turn) one-legged pivot step for both lead and follow. <p>Then, at 8:30 p.m., the Folk Voice Band brings their cheerful and lively music. In addition to the intrepid couple, Birgit and Phil Ages, Joe Michaels and Frank Brown will round out their international flavor. Besides a great array of Nordic tunes, they will get us up and dancing together with some favorite Danish mixers.</p><span><b>Skandia members, $10; nonmembers, $15; kids, free  The price of admission includes a free dance class.</b></span>"

The evening will start with the<b> Six-feet Back Band</b>, which was formed in 2020 and plays a wide repertoire of energetic tunes from <br>Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. As is the case for our larger groups, you will know several of the band’s members from other bands or as dancers. Our second three-member band is <b>LAB162</b>, who maximize the number of strings per tune per musician and the number of instruments per <br>musician relative to other bands in this region.
